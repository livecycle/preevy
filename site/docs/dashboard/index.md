## **Share code changes. Collect feedback.**

Livecycle makes it easy to not only create previews of your latest changes, but also to share them and collect feedback in context.

Using the Dashboard, you can invite teammates to ephemeral environments to review and provide feedback. Each team member can see the open projects assigned to them and review changes in their browser.
