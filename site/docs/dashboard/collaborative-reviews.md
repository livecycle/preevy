## Collaborative reviews

Livecycle makes it easy to not only create previews of your latest changes, but also to share them and collect feedback in context. 

Each of Livecycle's shared preview environments include built-in tools that enable technical teammates to review changes and access services from a browser, so they can see real-time logging, catch errors and execute commands in a terminal, and you can collaboratively fix issues mug earlier in the development lifecycle.
