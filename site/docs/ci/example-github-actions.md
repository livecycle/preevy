# GitHub Actions

In this section we'll show an example of how to run Preevy using our GitHub Actions [preevy-up](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/preevy-up) and [preevy-down](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/preevy-down) with AWS as the VM provider.

# Preevy-Up

## Authentication

In this example Preevy will get your stored profile from AWS S3, and will deploy the repo using docker compose file to AWS Lightsail.
Make sure the action has [sufficient permissions](/drivers/aws-lightsail#required-permissions) to AWS.
See: [Assume a rule](https://github.com/aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials#assuming-a-role)

Once configured, use the [AWS for GitHub Actions](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/configure-aws-credentials-for-github-actions) action:

```yml
- uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v2
  with:
    role-to-assume: [your-aws-role]
    aws-region: [your-aws-region]
```

## Permissions
Make sure your code has the required permissions. we are using `pull-requests: write` to write our deployed URLs on the PR, `contents: read` to read the docker file, and `id-token` for GitHub's OIDC Token endpoint

```yaml
permissions:
  id-token: write
  contents: read
  pull-requests: write
```

## Running Preevy
Make sure your code is checked out before using the preevy up action, using the [Checkout](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/checkout) action:

```yaml
- uses: actions/checkout@v3
- uses: livecycle/preevy-up-action@latest
```

With the `profile-url` arg, load the Preevy profile you [configured earlier](/ci/overview#how-to-run-preevy-from-the-ci), e.g.
Use the `docker-compose-yaml-paths` to point to your docker compose file
```yaml
  profile-url: "s3://preview-8450209857-ci?region=us-east-1"
  docker-compose-yaml-paths: "./docker/docker-compose.yaml"
```

## Complete workflow example

```yml
name: Deploy Preevy environment
on:
  pull_request:
    types:
      - opened
      - synchronize
permissions:
  id-token: write
  contents: read
  pull-requests: write
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v2
        with:
          role-to-assume: arn:aws:iam::12345678:role/my-role
          aws-region: eu-west-1
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: livecycle/preevy-up-action@latest
        id: preevy
        with:
          profile-url: "s3://preevy-12345678-my-profile?region=eu-west-1"
          # docker-compose-yaml-paths arg will point to the `docker-compose.yml` file. if you have multiple docker compose files, you can add them as a comma seperated string like so `'docker-compose.yml,docker-compose.dev.yml'`
          docker-compose-yaml-paths: "./docker/docker-compose.yaml"
      - uses: mshick/add-pr-comment@v2
        with:
          message: ${{ steps.preevy.outputs.urls-markdown }}
```

# Preevy-Down
Use this action to stop and delete a preview environment using the Preevy CLI when the Pull Request is merged or closed.

## Teardown the Preevy environment
Just like the preevy-up action, we need to authenticate and checkout.

```yaml
- uses: actions/checkout@v3
- uses: livecycle/preevy-down-action@latest
```

With the `profile-url` arg, load the Preevy profile you [configured earlier](/ci/overview#how-to-run-preevy-from-the-ci), with the AWS S3 permissions we granted earlier.

```yaml
  profile-url: "s3://preevy-12345678-my-profile?region=eu-west-1"
```
This part is a bit different from the preevy-up action,
you should pass the args as if you are passing them to the [preevy down command](/cli-reference/down),
note the `-f` before the docker-compose file path.
```yaml
  args: "-f ./docker/docker-compose.yaml"
```
for multiple docker files you can use `"-f ./docker/docker-compose.yaml -f ./docker/docker-compose.dev.yaml"`

```yml
name: Teardown Preevy environment
on:
  pull_request:
    types:
      - closed
permissions:
  id-token: write
  contents: read
jobs:
  teardown:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v2
        with:
          role-to-assume: arn:aws:iam::12345678:role/my-role
          aws-region: eu-west-1
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: livecycle/preevy-down-action@latest
        id: preevy
        with:
          profile-url: "s3://preevy-12345678-my-profile?region=eu-west-1"
          args: "-f ./docker/docker-compose.yaml"
```
