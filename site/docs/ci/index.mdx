Preevy is designed to be easily run in CI/CD workflows,
such as [GH Actions](https://github.com/features/actions), [Circle CI](https://circleci.com/) and others.

The most common use case for a CI job that runs Preevy is to have a live preview environment for every Pull Request
as part of the review process. This allows for [more collaborative and inclusive review workflows](/intro/motivation)

## Walkthrough: Running Preevy in your GitHub actions CI

***In this example, we'll use GitHub Actions CI and AWS Lightsail as a cloud provider.***

For GitHub Actions with Google Cloud, see a complete recipe at the [`livecycle/preevy-gha-gce-demo` repo](https://github.com/livecycle/preevy-gha-gce-demo).

### 1. Install Preevy and create a profile

The Preevy [profile](https://preevy.dev/intro/under-the-hood#profile-configuration) provides a mechanism for storing and sharing configuration and state between different machines.
This allows sharing of environments between different CI jobs, or different developers.
Using the same profile between different CI runs ensures a consistent configuration and allows for stable URLs for your preview environments.

Preevy includes built-in support for saving profiles on [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) and [Google Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage/).
You can also store the profile on the local filesystem and copy it manually before running Preevy - we won't show this method here.

- To create the Preevy profile, first install the Preevy CLI locally:

```bash
# npm:
npm install -g preevy
# yarn:
yarn add -g preevy
# or use npx to run the CLI without installing it:
npx preevy ...
```

- Then, set up a Preevy profile:

```bash
preevy init [profile-name]
```

- When asked to choose a **cloud provider**, choose either `AWS Lightsail`.

You will be asked for the default AWS region in which to create AWS resources.

- Next, choose where to store your profile.

The profile needs to be stored in the cloud where it can be accessed by your CI machines.

When asked where to **store** the profile, choose `AWS S3`.
The URL displayed in your terminal should look something like `s3://preevy-12345678-my-profile?region=eu-west-1`

- Note the URL displayed in your terminal - this is the Preevy profile URL which we'll use in the actions below.

### 2. Make sure GitHub Actions workflows have AWS permissions

In this example, we'll be using the [`aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials` action](https://github.com/aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials) with GitHub's [OIDC provider](https://github.com/aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials#oidc).
Make sure the configured role has the [required permissions](/deploy-runtimes/aws-lightsail#required-aws-permissions).

### 3. Create your GitHub Actions workflows

We'll create two workflows:

The `Deploy Preevy environment` workflow will create the preview environments when a PR is opened or updated.

The `Teardown Preevy environment` workflow will bring down the running preview environments when the PR is closed.

- For the `Deploy Preevy environment` workflow, create the file `preevy-up.yaml` in the `.github/workflows` directory of your repo:

```yaml
name: Deploy Preevy environment
on:
  pull_request:
    types:
      - opened
      - reopened
      - synchronize

permissions:
  id-token: write
  contents: read

  # Needed to write a PR comment with the environment URLs
  pull-requests: write

jobs:
  deploy:
    timeout-minutes: 15

    # allow a single job to run per PR
    concurrency: preevy-${{ github.event.number }}

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v2
        with:
          role-to-assume: arn:aws:iam::12345678:role/my-role
          aws-region: eu-west-1

      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - uses: livecycle/preevy-up-action@v2.4.0
        id: preevy
        with:
          profile-url: "${{ vars.PREEVY_PROFILE_URL }}"
          docker-compose-yaml-paths: "./docker/docker-compose.yaml"

      # Change `frontend` and `3000` in this step to your main service and port
      # This will appear as the GH environment URL
      - id: store_url
        name: Store URL of frontend
        run: |
          echo url=$(jq -r '.[] | select(.service=="frontend" and .port==3000).url' "${{ steps.preevy_up.outputs.urls-file }}") >> "$GITHUB_OUTPUT"
```

- For the `Teardown Preevy environment` workflow, create the file `preevy-down.yaml` in the `.github/workflows` directory of your repo:

```yaml
name: Teardown Preevy environment
on:
  pull_request:
    types:
      - closed
permissions:
  id-token: write
  contents: read

  # needed to update the PR comment with the environment URLs
  pull-requests: write
jobs:
  teardown:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v2
        with:
          role-to-assume: arn:aws:iam::12345678:role/my-role
          aws-region: eu-west-1

      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: livecycle/preevy-down-action@v1.4.0
        id: preevy
        with:
          profile-url: "${{ vars.PREEVY_PROFILE_URL }}"
          docker-compose-yaml-paths: "./docker/docker-compose.yaml"
```

- Add a [GitHub action configuration variable](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/variables#defining-configuration-variables-for-multiple-workflows) named `PREEVY_PROFILE_URL` and set the value to the URL printed at the `preevy init` output.

### 4. Get Automatic GitHub Notifications

You're all set! When you open a PR, Preevy will now build preview environments.
The [Preevy Github Plugin](/github-plugin) will automatically detect the GitHub context and post a comment on your PR with the links to each of the relevant services when they are available for review.
Teammates can simply click these links and preview your latest changes in their browsers.
