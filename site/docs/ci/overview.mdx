# Continuous Integration - Overview

`preevy` is designed to be easily run by CI/CD tools, such as [GH Actions](https://github.com/features/actions), [Circle CI](https://circleci.com/) and others.  
By sharing [profiles](/intro/under-the-hood#profile-configuration), `preevy` is able to easily deploy to the same VM when new code is pushed to some branch.

The most common use-case for a CI job that runs `preevy` is to have a live preview environment for every PR/MR opened for review. This allows for [more collaborative and inclusive review workflows](/intro/motivation)

## How to run `preevy` from the CI

To run `preevy` in your CI, start by creating a profile your CI can use to deploy its environment. Run:

```bash
preevy init [profile-name]
```

When asked where to store the profile, choose `s3`

<img src={StoreInS3Screenshot} width="75%" />

<br />
<br />

Then, choose a URL to store the profile (`preevy` will conveniently suggest one
for you).  
It should looke something like `s3://preview-8450209857-ci?region=us-east-1`

Now, from inside your CI pipeline, import the profile:

```bash
preevy init --from "s3://preview-8450209857-ci?region=us-east-1"
```

Finally, run

```bash
preevy up
```

Next, we're going to set up an example pipeline, using GitHub Actions
