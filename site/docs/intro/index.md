## Preevy - Easily create and manage ephemeral environments

Preevy is an Open Source tool from Livecycle designed to easily provision, manage, and expose ephemeral environments for containerized applications in the cloud.

These environments are inexpensive, easy to integrate, customizable, and accessible for both technical and non-technical users.

It’s simple, flexible, and doesn’t require deep DevOps knowledge, making it ideal for adding preview environments to your “pull/merge request” flows.

Preevy can deploy your app with public or protected access, on the public internet or inside your existing private network.
