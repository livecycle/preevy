# Preevy

<span style={{ fontSize: "x-large" }}>
  Provision <span style={{fontStyle: "italic"}}>preview environments</span> for docker-comopse applications with minimal
  configuration
</span>

## Introduction

use `preevy` to provision your [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) application with minimal configuration, as simple as running `preevy up`, then will output sharable URL for every service in your configuration.

## Getting Started

Preevy is designed to be easy to use with an API close to `docker compose`:

Install the CLI globally

```bash npm2yarn
npm install -g preevy
```

Or use it directly

```bash
npx preevy <command>
```

Set up a profile

```bash
preevy init
```

From the same directory you run `docker comopse up` run:

```bash
preevy up
```
