## Introduction

Use Preevy to provision your [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) application with minimal configurations.<br/>
Simply run `preevy up`, and Preevy will return a public URL for every service in your configuration.

You can read more about the Preevy [origin story and motivation](/intro/motivation).

## Getting Started

Preevy is designed to be easy to use, with an API smiliar to [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).

1. Install the CLI globally

  ```bash npm2yarn
  npm install -g preevy
  ```

  Or use it directly

  ```bash
  npx preevy <command>
  ```

2. Choose the cloud provider you're going to use and configure credentials:
   - For AWS: use `aws login` or `aws configure`. See [AWS lightsail credentials configurations](/drivers/aws-lightsail#credentials-configuration).
   - For GCP: use `gcloud auth application-default login`. See [GCP credentials configuration](/drivers/gcp-gce#credentials-configuration)

  - In AWS, it could be by using `aws login` or `aws configure`
  - In GCP, it could be by using 
3. Set up a profile

  ```bash
  preevy init
  ```

4. From the same directory you run `docker comopse up` run:

  ```bash
  preevy up
  ```
<br />

:::info Cloud provider credentials
Managing and provisioning preview environments in Preevy, requires access and credentials to a cloud provider. Currently AWS and GCP are supported, but more providers are [coming soon](/roadmap#more-cloud-drivers).
Once you install and initialize your cloud provider CLI, Preevy will recognize and employ your configuration settings.


For more info, see [AWS lightsail credentials configurations](/drivers/aws-lightsail#credentials-configuration), or [GCP credentials configuration](/drivers/gcp-gce#credentials-configuration)
