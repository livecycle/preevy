  for docker-comopse applications with minimal configuration

## Introduction

Use `preevy` to provision your [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) application with minimal configurations, as simple as running `preevy up`.<br/>
`preevy` will then output a public URL for every service in your configuration.

You can read about the [origin and motivation for preevy](/intro/motivation).

## Getting Started

Preevy is designed to be easy to use with an API smiliar to `docker compose`.

:::info Cloud credentials
To manage and provision preview environments in `preevy`, cloud credentials are necessary.<br />
In case you have already installed and set up the [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/), `preevy` will recognize and employ your configuration settings.
:::

Install the CLI globally

```bash npm2yarn
npm install -g preevy
```

Or use it directly

```bash
npx preevy <command>
```

Set up a profile

```bash
preevy init
```

From the same directory you run `docker comopse up` run:

```bash
preevy up
```
