## Introduction

Use `preevy` to provision your [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) application with minimal configurations, as simple as running `preevy up`.<br/>
`preevy` will then output a public URL for every service in your configuration.

## Getting Started

Preevy is designed to be easy to use with an API smiliar to `docker compose`.

Install the CLI globally

```bash npm2yarn
npm install -g preevy
```

Or use it directly

```bash
npx preevy <command>
```

Set up a profile

```bash
preevy init
```

From the same directory you run `docker comopse up` run:

```bash
preevy up
```
