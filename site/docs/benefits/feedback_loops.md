# Shorter feedback loops

Feedback is good. But endless feedback loops are not. And that's why many developers find themselves frustrated in feedback loops that seem to go on forever. 

Preevy tightens the feedback loop instantly. Ephemeral environments let you share your work quickly and easily with other stakeholders, and the built-in collaboration and annotation tools bring you clear review feedback in context. This makes it much easier and faster to identify issues, address them, ship code and move on.
