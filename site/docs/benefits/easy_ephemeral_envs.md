# Easily provision ephemeral environments

At Livecycle, we believe that preview environments are an integral part of any development flow, in any engineering team. These non-production, ephemeral environments, created for every Pull Request, can significantly improve PR workflows.

In recent years, preview environments have become increasingly popular, with some PaaS providers even offering deeply integrated preview environments. However, setting up preview environments can be complex and costly, which is why many teams have been hesitant to implement them.

Preevy makes it simple to provision, automate, and share preview environments within your PR flow.
