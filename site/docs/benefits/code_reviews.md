# Hassle-free code reviews

By provisioning shareable ephemeral environments with Preevy, you make it easier for other developers on the team to review your code changes. Your technical peers can see a visual environment that reflects the state of your latest code, and they can access the backend services to identify and debug any issues that are found.
