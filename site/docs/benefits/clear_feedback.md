# Clear feedback from non-technical stakeholders

As a developer, you often need less technical teammates to review the latest changes and sign off before they go live. But collecting this feedback from can be a huge headache. 

Designers, QA, product, marketing, and management aren't involved in the actual development, so they are often the last to review and comment, and their feedback usually comes back to you as scattered, unclear, bits and pieces.

But with Preevy's preview environments, everyone becomes part of the review process from the start. And with our built-in collaboration and annotation tools, the environments collect clear feedback for you in context, so you see everything clearly, in one place, at one time.
