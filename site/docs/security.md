## Security

In case you find a security issue or have something you would like to discuss, refer to our [security policy](https://github.com/livecycle/preevy/blob/main/security.md).

### Private environments

Preevy can add an authentication layer to your provisioned environments. When you configure your service as [private](https://preevy.dev/recipes/private-services/) the Tunnel Server restricts access based on a pre-shared secret or a Livecycle login (SSO via Google/Microsoft/GitHub).

### Notice on preview environments exposure

Services on provisioned environments are not exposed directly, but rather via a [tunnel](https://livecycle.io/blogs/preevy-proxy-service-2/) created by the tunneling server.

Every Compose service is exposed individually with a generated URL in the following format:
`https://{service}-{[port]}-{env-id}-{client-id}.{tunnel-server-domain}`. If the service exposes a single port, the `port` part is omitted. See [here](https://livecycle.io/blogs/preevy-proxy-service-1/) for a more detailed explanation.

- `env-id` can be specified using the `--id` flag of the `preevy up` command, or automatically generated by git context.
- `client-id` is a random identifier based on the profile's public tunneling SSH key (generated in `preevy init`).
- `tunnel-service-domain` is where the tunnel service is hosted. It can be specified using the `--tunnel-url` flag of the `preevy up` command, and defaults to our free service at `*.livecycle.run`.

### Network isolation

The Tunnel Server can be deployed on a your private network (e.g, VPC), which access to your environments at the network level.
