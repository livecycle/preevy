## **Add 5555555 to your workflow**

Livecycle is flexible by design, so there are several ways to add Livecycle to your workflow:

- **Use our open source CLI to create self-hosted preview environments** - Our open source CLI “Preevy” provisions ephemeral preview environments on your cloud provider or Kubernetes cluster with a single command.
- **Add Livecycle to your CI and get deploy previews for every PR** - By adding Livecycle to your CI/CD pipeline, you can automatically provision shareable preview environments for every commit or pull request.
- **Instantly share local containers -** The Livecycle Docker Extension lets you share your local containerized app and get feedback while the code is still on your machine, without the hassle of CI builds or staging servers.
- **Start collaborative review cycles with the team** - Every shared Livecycle preview environment includes built-in feedback tools that collect technical and visual feedback from the team. This means faster, more collaborative review cycles for everyone invovled.
