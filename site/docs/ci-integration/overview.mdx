# Continuous Integration - Overview

Preevy is designed to be easily run in CI/CD workflows, such as [GH Actions](https://github.com/features/actions), [Circle CI](https://circleci.com/) and others.

The most common use-case for a CI job that runs Preevy is to have a live preview environment for every Pull Request as part of the review process. This allows for [more collaborative and inclusive review workflows](/intro/motivation)

## Running Preevy in your CI pipeline

### Make sure your profile is accessible remotely

The Preevy Profile contains your tunneling key and other configuration data. The tunneling key determines the URLs generated per environment.

Preevy stores the profile on a file, on your local FS or on a remote storage on your cloud provider - currently AWS S3 and Google Cloud Storage are supported.
To use the profile across CI jobs, it needs to be stored remotely.
To create a new profile, run `preevy init`. To start using an existing profile stored remotely, run `preevy init --from <profile-location>`.

#### Option 1: Create a new Preevy Profile on a remote location

```bash
preevy init [profile-name]
```

When asked where to store the profile, choose `AWS S3` or `Google Cloud Storage`.

Then, choose a URL to store the profile (Preevy will conveniently suggest one for you).
For S3, it should look something like `s3://preview-123456789-ci?region=us-east-1`

#### Option 2: If you already have a profile stored locally, migrate it to a remote location:

```bash
preevy profile cp --target-storage s3 # to use AWS S3
preevy profile cp --target-storage gs # to use Google Cloud Storage
```

Once the profile has migrated to a remote location, you can specify the new location URL in the `preevy init --from` command - see below.

### In your CI pipeline, import the profile

Use the following commands in your CI job to import the Preevy Profile and provision an environment for your PR:

```bash
preevy init --from "s3://preview-123456789-ci?region=us-east-1"
preevy up
```

See the next sections for detailed examples using GitHub Actions.
