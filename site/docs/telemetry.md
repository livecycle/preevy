# Telemetry

The Preevy CLI collects telemetry data to help us understand product usage and direct future development.

The data collected is anonymous and cannot be used to uniquely identify a user. Access to the data is limited to Livecycle's employees and not shared with 3rd parties.

To see the collected data, set the environment variable `PREEVY_TELEMETRY_FILE` to a filename.

We appreciate the usage data sent to us as - it's the most basic and raw type of feedback we get from our users. However, if you are concerned about sending out data, you may choose to disable telemetry.

Telemetry collection can be disabled by setting the environment variable `PREEVY_DISABLE_TELEMETRY` to 1 or true.
