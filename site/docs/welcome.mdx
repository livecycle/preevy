Preevy is an open source tool from Livecycle designed to easily provision, manage, and expose ephemeral environments for containerized applications in the cloud.

These environments are inexpensive, easy to integrate, customizable, and accessible for both technical and non-technical users.

It’s simple, flexible, and doesn’t require deep DevOps knowledge, making it ideal for adding preview environments to your “pull/merge request” flows.
