# Contributing

Thanks for considering a contribution!

Preevy is Open Source and we love to receive contributions from the community. Here are a few ideas for contributions:

* Expand and correct the documentation where needed
* Add examples and how-tos for using Preevy in various scenarios: Guides on adding Preview Environments for your favorite front-end framework, Example CI integrations for more providers.
* Submit bug reports and fixes
* Improve the UX
* Add automated tests
* Add missing functionality; small or big features (example of the latter: drivers for more cloud providers)

When contributing, please follow the guidelines:

1. **Contributors should be Preevy users**. If you haven't used Preevy yet, please take a few moments to set up an environment on your cloud provider, or even on a local K8S cluster.
1. Open a PR, issue or discussion on the repo to communicate your intents
1. Either add automated tests or make sure to test the relevant adjacent flows manually.
1. Fix the documentation to reflect code changes where applicable.
